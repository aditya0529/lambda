This script appears to be a configuration file for AWS CodeBuild, designed to validate AWS CloudFormation templates using Cfn-Guard. Below is a detailed explanation of each line of the script without modifying the code:

### **Script Explanation**

```yaml
version: 0.2
env:
  variables:
    DEFAULT_ENV: "prod" # Default environment variable set to "prod".
    # DO NOT CHANGE     # Comments indicating sections that should not be changed.
    INCLUDE_LOCAL_DIRS: "" # No local directories are included by default.
    EXCLUDE_DIRS: "" # No directories are excluded by default.
phases:
  install:
    commands:
      - echo "Checking CFN Guard Version..." # Prints the message to the console.
      - cfn-guard --version # Checks and prints the installed version of Cfn-Guard.
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo "Fetch project details" # Prints the message to indicate fetching project details.
      - build_project_name=$(echo "$CODEBUILD_BUILD_ID" | cut -d ":" -f 1) # Extracts the build project name from CODEBUILD_BUILD_ID.
      - codepipeline_project_details=$(aws codepipeline get-pipeline --name "$build_project_name") # Fetches the project details from AWS CodePipeline using the extracted project name.
      - cfn_guard_bucket_name=$(echo "$codepipeline_project_details" | jq -r ".pipeline.stages[].actions[].configuration.S3Bucket") # Extracts the S3 bucket name for Cfn-Guard from the pipeline configuration.
      - echo "COMPLIANCE CHECK BUCKETNAME:" $cfn_guard_bucket_name # Prints the extracted S3 bucket name.
      - cfn_guard_root_dir=$(echo "$codepipeline_project_details" | jq -r ".pipeline.stages[].actions[].configuration.S3ObjectKey" | cut -d "/" -f 1) # Extracts the root directory from the S3 object key.
      - echo "Syncing Guard rules from S3 to build host" # Prints the message to indicate syncing of Guard rules.
      - aws s3 sync s3://$cfn_guard_bucket_name/$cfn_guard_root_dir $CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR/$cfn_guard_root_dir --quiet # Syncs the Cfn-Guard rules from S3 to the build host quietly.
  build:
    commands:
      - echo "Download Cloud Formation Template" # Prints the message indicating the start of template download.
      - mkdir cdk.out && cp -r $CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR/$cfn_guard_root_dir/cdk.out/*.template.* $CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR/cdk.out # Creates a directory named `cdk.out` and copies the CloudFormation templates into it.
      - echo "Downloading the validation.sh script from S3 to build host" # Prints the message to indicate the download of the validation script.
      - cfn_guard_script_paths=$(echo "$codepipeline_project_details" | jq -r ".pipeline.stages[].actions[].configuration.S3ObjectKey" | grep "validation.sh") # Extracts the path of the `validation.sh` script from the S3 bucket configuration.
      - aws s3 cp s3://$cfn_guard_bucket_name/$cfn_guard_script_paths $CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR/$cfn_guard_script_paths --quiet # Downloads the `validation.sh` script from S3 to the build host.
      - chmod +x $cfn_guard_script_paths # Makes the `validation.sh` script executable.
      - echo "Running compliance check validation script" # Prints the message before running the compliance validation script.
      - $cfn_guard_script_paths # Executes the downloaded `validation.sh` script.
  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo "CloudFormation Guard validation completed" # Prints the message indicating the completion of the Guard validation.
artifacts:
  files:
    - cdk.out/** # Specifies that the contents of `cdk.out` are to be included as build artifacts.
```

### **Explanation of Key Points**
- **`install` Phase**: This phase checks the version of Cfn-Guard installed on the system.
- **`pre_build` Phase**: It fetches details about the CodePipeline project and syncs the Cfn-Guard rules from the specified S3 bucket to the local build environment.
- **`build` Phase**: This phase downloads the CloudFormation template and the validation script (`validation.sh`) from S3, makes the script executable, and runs it to perform compliance checks.
- **`post_build` Phase**: It indicates the end of the Cfn-Guard validation process.
- **`artifacts` Section**: Specifies which files or directories are to be saved as build artifacts after the build completes.

This script is designed to automate compliance checks by validating CloudFormation templates against predefined rules using Cfn-Guard within an AWS CodeBuild environment.
