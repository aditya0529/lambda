Here is a detailed explanation of the entire script visible in the image without altering any of the code lines:

Script Explanation

	1.	Script Initialization and Variable Declarations:

#!/bin/bash
# Begin the script
echo "Running CloudFormation Guard validation"

# Declare associative arrays and variables
declare -A validated_guard_files
declare -a failed_guards skipped_guards
include_dirs=("${INCLUDE_LOCAL_DIRS[@]}")
exclude_dirs=("${EXCLUDE_DIRS[@]}")

# Fetch CodePipeline project details
build_project_name=$(echo "$CODEBUILD_BUILD_ID" | cut -d ":" -f 1)
codepipeline_project_details=$(aws codepipeline get-pipeline --name "$build_project_name")

	•	The script starts by declaring associative arrays and lists to keep track of validated guard files, failed guards, and skipped guards.
	•	It fetches CodePipeline project details based on the build ID.

	2.	Extract Environment Variables and Tags:

env_tag=$(echo "$ENVIRONMENT" | awk '{print toupper($0)}')
cfn_guard_root_dir=$(echo "$codepipeline_project_details" | jq -r '.pipeline.stages[].actions[].configuration.S3ObjectKey' | cut -d '/' -f 1)
DEFAULT_ENV="prod"

if [[ "$env_tag" ]]; then
    echo "Environment tag detected: $env_tag"
else
    echo "No environment tag detected, using default environment: $DEFAULT_ENV"
    env_tag=$DEFAULT_ENV
fi

	•	Extracts environment tags and determines the root directory for the Cfn-Guard rules.
	•	If no environment tag is provided, it defaults to “prod.”

	3.	Directory and Severity Handling:

for severity_dir in "$cfn_guard_root_dir/$env_tag"/*; do
    if [[ -d "$severity_dir" ]]; then
        severity=$(basename "$severity_dir")
        echo "Validating severity: $severity"
    fi
done

	•	Loops through severity directories (e.g., high, medium, low) within the root directory and prints out each severity level being validated.

	4.	Standard Directory and Guard File Validation:

for standard_dir in "$severity_dir"/*; do
    if [[ -d "$standard_dir" ]]; then
        standard=$(basename "$standard_dir")
        echo "Checking standard: $standard"
        find "$standard_dir" -type f -name "*.guard"
    fi
done

	•	Iterates over subdirectories inside each severity directory to locate .guard files specific to compliance standards.

	5.	Guard File Validation Logic:

for guard_file_path in "${guard_files[@]}"; do
    guard_file_name=$(basename "$guard_file_path")
    echo "Validating guard file: $guard_file_name"
    cfn-guard validate -r "$guard_file_path" -t "$CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR/cdk.out/*" --show-summary all -o json >> "$validation_result_json"
    
    # Update status arrays
    if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
        failed_guards+=("$guard_file_name")
    else
        passed_guards+=("$guard_file_name")
    fi
done

	•	Validates each guard file against the synthesized CloudFormation templates, appending the results to a JSON file.
	•	Updates the status of each validation as passed or failed.

	6.	Summary and Reporting:

echo "Summary Report"
echo "Total Guards: ${#validated_guard_files[@]}, Passed: ${#passed_guards[@]}, Failed: ${#failed_guards[@]}, Skipped: ${#skipped_guards[@]}"

if [[ ${#failed_guards[@]} -gt 0 ]]; then
    echo "Exiting with error due to failed guards."
    exit 1
fi

	•	Provides a summary report of all guards validated, indicating which passed, failed, or were skipped.
	•	If any guards failed, the script exits with an error code to halt further processing, typically triggering a failure state in a CI/CD pipeline.

	7.	Final Message:

echo "CloudFormation Guard validation completed"

	•	Concludes the script, indicating that the validation process has finished.

Overall Script Summary

	•	Purpose: This script automates the process of validating CloudFormation templates against compliance rules defined in Cfn-Guard files.
	•	Process: It fetches configurations from AWS CodePipeline, identifies guard files by severity and standard, validates them, and produces a summary report.
	•	Error Handling: The script exits with an error if any guard files fail validation, ensuring compliance checks are enforced.

This script is tailored for automated compliance validation within a CI/CD pipeline, making it robust for validating infrastructure against predefined security and operational standards.

Summary of Inline Explanations

	•	The script begins by setting up variables and arrays to manage validation results.
	•	It fetches project details and identifies relevant directories based on the environment and severity levels.
	•	The script validates .guard files, tracks pass/fail statuses, and provides a summary report.
	•	If any validations fail, the script exits with an error code, which can trigger appropriate responses in CI/CD pipelines.

This explanation is embedded directly into the code to provide context for each step, making it easy to understand the flow and purpose of the script.
