1. What is ca-trust and Why Copy Netskope Certs There?
The ca-trust refers to the system's certificate trust store, which contains trusted root and intermediate certificates used for validating SSL/TLS connections. When an application (like a web browser, API client, or any network service) makes a secure connection to a server, it checks the server’s certificate against the trusted certificates in the ca-trust store. If the server’s certificate chains up to a trusted root, the connection is considered secure.

Why Copy Netskope Certs to ca-trust?
When Netskope is used for SSL/TLS inspection (i.e., decrypting and inspecting encrypted traffic), 
it acts as an intermediary and re-encrypts traffic with its own certificate. 
To avoid SSL/TLS errors (like "untrusted certificate" errors), the Netskope CA certificate must be added to the system’s trusted certificate store (ca-trust), so that the system recognizes Netskope as a legitimate certificate issuer.
