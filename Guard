Here’s a structured document for your Confluence page that outlines the process of using Docker to build your project with CFN Guard rules and validation using a CDK container. I’ve broken down the details to be clear and informative:

Documentation: CFN Guard Validation using Docker and CDK

Overview

This document provides a detailed guide on how to use Docker to build a project with CFN Guard rules and run validation using the AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) container setup. It describes the use of CFN Guard rules files, the validation script, and the process to integrate these components into your development workflow using Docker.

Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

	•	Docker: To build and run the container.
	•	AWS CDK: For infrastructure deployment.
	•	Node.js: Required to work with AWS CDK.
	•	AWS CLI: To manage your AWS resources.
	•	CFN Guard: For validating AWS CloudFormation templates.

Step-by-Step Process

1. Preparing the CodeBuild Repository

The CFN Guard rules and the validation.sh script are stored in your CodeBuild repository. During the Docker build process, these files are copied into the Docker image.

	•	CFN Guard Rules: These files contain policies to validate AWS CloudFormation templates.
	•	validation.sh: A script to automate the validation process.

2. Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image with your CodeBuild repository files, use the following steps:

	1.	Navigate to the Repository:

cd /path/to/your/codebuild-repo


	2.	Build the Docker Image:

docker build -t cfn-guard-validator .

This command creates a Docker image named cfn-guard-validator and ensures that the CFN Guard rules and the validation.sh script are copied into the image.

3. Running the Docker Container Locally with Mounted CDK Output

The AWS CDK generates the CloudFormation templates in the cdk.out folder when you deploy or synthesize your stack. This folder should be mounted to the Docker container so that it can access the templates for validation.

	1.	Generate CDK Templates:

cdk synth

This command creates the cdk.out directory with the generated CloudFormation templates.

	2.	Run the Docker Container:

docker run -v $(pwd)/cdk.out:/cdk.out cfn-guard-validator ./validation.sh

This command does the following:
	•	Mounts the cdk.out folder: Ensures the container has access to the CloudFormation templates generated by the CDK.
	•	Executes the validation script: Runs validation.sh to validate the CloudFormation templates against the CFN Guard rules.

4. Validation Process

The validation.sh script is designed to automatically validate the CloudFormation templates using CFN Guard. The process involves checking the templates against the predefined rules to ensure they adhere to the required standards and best practices.

	•	Validation Output: The script will provide output indicating which rules passed or failed, along with details on any violations.

5. Handling Validation Failures

If the validation script identifies any issues, review the output logs to understand the violations. Common causes of failures may include:

	•	Non-compliance with security best practices.
	•	Incorrect resource configurations.
	•	Missing or misconfigured parameters.

6. Best Practices

	•	Regularly Update CFN Guard Rules: Ensure that your rules are up-to-date to catch the latest compliance and security standards.
	•	Automate Validation in CI/CD: Integrate the validation process into your CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early in the deployment process.
	•	Review Logs: Always review the validation logs to understand failures and take corrective action.

7. Additional Notes

	•	The cdk.out folder must always be mounted to the Docker container for validation to work properly.
	•	Ensure that the Docker image is rebuilt whenever there are updates to the CFN Guard rules or the validation.sh script.

Conclusion

This document provides a structured approach to building and running Docker containers for validating AWS CloudFormation templates using CFN Guard with AWS CDK. Following these steps will help ensure your infrastructure meets compliance and security standards before deployment.
