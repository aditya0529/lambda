echo "Excluded directories and guard files for validation: ${exclude_dirs[@]}"

Explanation of Each Line:

	1.	Declare Arrays:

declare -a validated_guard_files failed_guards passed_guards skipped_guards
declare -a all_guard_files

	•	These lines declare arrays to track different states of guard files during validation (validated, failed, passed, skipped).

	2.	Fetch Project Details:

codepipeline_project_details=$(aws codebuild batch-get-projects --names "$BUILD_PROJECT_NAME")

	•	This line fetches the details of the CodeBuild project specified by the $BUILD_PROJECT_NAME using the AWS CLI.

	3.	Convert Lists into Arrays:

IFS=', ' read -r -a include_local_dirs <<< "$INCLUDE_LOCAL_DIRS"
IFS=', ' read -r -a exclude_dirs <<< "$EXCLUDE_DIRS"

	•	Converts comma-separated strings of directories (INCLUDE_LOCAL_DIRS and EXCLUDE_DIRS) into arrays for easier handling in the script.

	4.	Extract Environment Variables:

env_tag=$(echo "$codepipeline_project_details" | jq -r '.projects[].environment.environmentVariables[] | select(.name == "SW_ENVIRONMENT").value')
cfn_guard_root_dir=$(echo "$codepipeline_project_details" | jq -r '.projects[].environment.environmentVariables[] | select(.name == "ROOT_DIR").value')

	•	Uses jq to parse the JSON output from AWS CLI and extract specific environment variables (SW_ENVIRONMENT and ROOT_DIR) from the project details.

	5.	Set Default Environment:

DEFAULT_ENV="prod"

	•	Defines the default environment as “prod” in case the environment variable is not set.

	6.	Check Environment Variable:

if [[ -z "$env_tag" ]]; then
    echo "Environment variable SW_ENVIRONMENT in the build project is not set. So, using default environment: $DEFAULT_ENV"
    env_tag=$DEFAULT_ENV
fi

	•	Checks if env_tag is empty. If it is, it sets env_tag to the default environment (prod) and informs the user.

	7.	Exit if No Environment Tag:

if [[ -z "$env_tag" ]]; then
    echo "No environment tag and default environment have been set. So Exiting."
    exit 1
fi

	•	Exits the script with an error if env_tag is still not set, ensuring that the script doesn’t proceed without an environment context.

	8.	Log Environment Being Checked:

echo "Checking for $env_tag Environment"

	•	Outputs which environment the script is checking, helping with debugging and clarity during execution.

	9.	Log Excluded Validations:

echo "Excluded validation for Service(s): ${service_dirs[@]}"
echo "Excluded validation for Severity: ${severity_dirs[@]}"
echo "Excluded validation for Standards: ${standards_dirs[@]}"
echo "Excluded directories and guard files for validation: ${exclude_dirs[@]}"

	•	Logs which services, severities, and standards are excluded from validation, as well as any specific directories or guard files that are excluded, providing transparency in the validation process.

This code is designed to set up the environment for validating AWS CloudFormation templates using Cfn-Guard. 
It ensures that necessary configurations are correctly loaded, exclusions are properly handled, and the script exits safely when configurations are missing.
