Key Sections and Explanations:

	1.	Imports:
	•	sys, json, boto3, and ClientError are imported for AWS interactions and error handling.
	•	logging is imported for creating and controlling log outputs.
	2.	Logging Setup:
	•	The log level is retrieved from the environment using os.getenv() and defaults to INFO if not specified.
	•	A logger object is created, and the log level is set.
	3.	Lambda Handler:
	•	The lambda_handler function serves as the entry point for AWS Lambda. It processes events and interacts with EC2 to modify security group rules.
	•	event and context are passed as parameters, typical in Lambda functions.
	4.	Security Group Description:
	•	A filter is applied to get security groups named "default". The describe_security_groups function returns details about the group.
	•	The client.describe_security_groups() call retrieves the security groups based on the filter provided.
	5.	RequestType Handling:
	•	If the RequestType is ‘Create’ or ‘Update’, the security group is evaluated for its ingress and egress permissions, which are revoked if they exist.
	•	For Delete events, the function skips the deletion action since no security group changes are needed.
	6.	Egress and Ingress Rule Revoking:
	•	The security group’s outbound (IpPermissionsEgress) and inbound (IpPermissions) rules are checked, and they are revoked using the revoke_security_group_egress and revoke_security_group_ingress functions.
	•	Responses and exceptions from these AWS API calls are logged for tracking.
	7.	CloudFormation Response:
	•	Success or failure is communicated back to AWS CloudFormation using cfresponse.send(). This ensures that CloudFormation knows the outcome of the Lambda execution.
	•	If an error occurs during the response, the error message is logged and a failure message is sent back to CloudFormation.

Differences in Python 3.12:

	•	Pattern Matching: While Python 3.12 supports pattern matching, the structure of this code doesn’t directly benefit from it. However, future code might leverage pattern matching for better handling of complex conditions or data structures.
	•	Improved Error Messages: Python 3.12 has improved the clarity of error messages, which will make debugging more straightforward, though no changes in the code are necessary for this.
	•	Performance: There are performance improvements in Python 3.12, but the code does not need modifications to take advantage of them.

The code is now compatible with Python 3.12 and ready to be executed. If you need any further changes or refinements, feel free to ask!
