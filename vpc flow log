Key Sections and Explanations:

	1.	Imports:
	•	boto3: AWS SDK to interact with AWS services like Lambda and Organizations.
	•	os: For accessing environment variables.
	•	sys: Used to fetch details of exceptions during error handling.
	•	traceback: To generate and format stack traces in case of exceptions.
	•	json: For handling JSON objects, especially for payloads and logging.
	•	logging: For logging messages at various stages of execution.
	•	ClientError: Exception class for handling AWS service-specific errors.
	2.	Logging Setup:
	•	Logging is set to INFO level for general logs, and critical logging is enabled for boto3 and botocore to avoid verbose outputs from these libraries.
	3.	Get Active Accounts Function:
	•	get_org_accounts_list(): Retrieves a list of active AWS accounts from AWS Organizations using the list_accounts API.
	•	Pagination: Handles large numbers of accounts by paginating in chunks of 20.
	•	Logs an error if the API call fails and returns an empty list.
	4.	Lambda Handler:
	•	The main function that gets triggered by AWS Lambda. It:
	•	Retrieves the list of active accounts using get_org_accounts_list().
	•	Logs the list of active accounts to be processed.
	•	Uses the Lambda client to invoke another Lambda function (asynchronously) for each account.
	5.	Lambda Invocation:
	•	For each active account, the Lambda function is invoked using lambda_client.invoke().
	•	The payload consists of the account ID, and it uses InvocationType='Event' for asynchronous invocation, meaning the calling Lambda doesn’t wait for the invoked function to complete.
	•	The function name to invoke is retrieved from an environment variable, LAMBDA_HUB_FUNCTION_NAME.
	6.	Error Handling:
	•	If an error occurs during the Lambda invocation, detailed exception information is captured using sys.exc_info() and formatted with traceback.format_exception().
	•	Logs include the error type, message, and stack trace in JSON format for easier debugging.
	7.	Return Statement:
	•	After all the invocations are triggered, the function returns a success status with the message “Lambda executions triggered for all active accounts”.

Differences in Python 3.12:

	•	Error Handling: Python 3.12 includes improved error messages, but no specific changes are needed in this code to take advantage of them.
	•	Structural Pattern Matching: Python 3.12 introduces pattern matching, but the structure of this code doesn’t benefit from it since it deals with straightforward exception handling and iteration.
	•	Performance: Python 3.12’s general performance improvements will apply, but no code changes are necessary to leverage them.

This code is now adapted for Python 3.12 and ready to run. If you need any additional details or adjustments, feel free to ask!
